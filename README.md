4. EJS

## Novelty
1. This is a new concept, of actually opening the webpages which might give the user the required solutions to the problems in their code
2. Piping the data from python, then receiving it in Nodejs and redirecting the user to stack overflow pages
3. The use case is quite common and will solve a lot of problems as we all face issues while learning a new language or working on a project.

## Limitation
This tool is limited to python only for the time being and is dependent on the errors solutions to be present on Stack Overflow. Also, if the popups are not enabled, new webpages won't open.
